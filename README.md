# Loan-Default-Predictions-Project
Monitoring existing loans and identifying customers at risk of default helps banks manage and mitigate credit risk, A machine learning model to predict Default status based on customers data will help the bank to take wise decisions before lending loan
## Understand the data and analyse for any Outliers, null values and skewness.
Build a Machine learning model to predict the Nan values of Gender and fill it with the predicted values 
Preprocess the data and do Exploratory Data Analysis 
## Build a Machine Learning Model to Predict Loan Default Status and deploy it on Streamlit
make predictions taking input (Customer Details) from user and predict the Status of Loan using the ML model
